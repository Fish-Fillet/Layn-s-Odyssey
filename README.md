Welcome to Layn-s-Obyssey. This repo contains all the mods to use in Layn's MC server.
## Features

- The map is now 3 time larger than the old one (as taking 6 hours to cross the map was too small for someone)
- On the latest version of MC, 1.20.1
- Significaly modded terrains and biomes 
- No Enderman greif (they will still attack you @-@)
- Creepers explosion damage is auto repaired after a few seconds (this includes chests and items in them)
- Random chance of "Challenger Mods" to spawn. These are unique mods that are significaly tougher than normal mobs
- Pet freiendly fire is off. So no hurting pets buy any user, mobs can still hurt them

- Rideable sniffers. You can also put chests on them so you can travel with all your gear
